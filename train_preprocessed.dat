CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old female patient of Dr. X. The patient
presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain
which has been persistent. She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and
discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was &quot;normal.&quot; She was given oral antibiotics
of Cipro and Flagyl. She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia. She
is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago. She
denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena. Her last colonoscopy was
approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice.
The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in
normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. She has a
long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I
believe that he has not been re-consulted.
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or smoke.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of
breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS: Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.
HEENT: Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. The conjunctivae are non-
injected.
NECK: Supple.
CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN: Generally nondistended and soft. She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep
palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness. There is no
CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.
PELVIC: Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.
EXTREMITIES: Grossly and neurovascularly intact.
LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal.
Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184. Liver function tests otherwise normal. Electrolytes normal. Glucose
134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain
now more localized to the left lower quadrant. Currently is a nonacute abdomen. The working diagnosis
would be sigmoid diverticulitis. She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis. I would
recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth. The
patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery. We will consult her also for evaluation. The
patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically.
The case was discussed with the patient&#39;s primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no
indication for acute surgical intervention on today&#39;s date, although the patient will need close observation
and further diagnostic workup.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Possible free air under the diaphragm.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any
information. She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable
to give any history. On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have
what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for alcohol abuse. Unable to really gather any other information
because she is so obtunded.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture
from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO.
MEDICATIONS: Unable to evaluate.
ALLERGIES: UNABLE TO EVALUATE.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who
sees her on a regular basis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain.
PHYSICAL EXAM
VITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70.
GENERAL: She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any
use.
HEENT: Atraumatic.
NECK: Soft and supple.
LUNGS: Bilaterally diminished.
HEART: Regular.
ABDOMEN: Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any
tenderness.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift. Elevated AST at 138, with a
normal ALT at 38. Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8. Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium
of 2.8.
X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the
patient&#39;s physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of
the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the
diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.
ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology.
PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who
has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her
stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised
her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her
neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the
time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an
exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then
she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart
catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain
symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On
08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD
lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the
left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be
having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-
eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She
had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm
pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three
sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive
bladder.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Detrol LA 2 mg once a day.
2. Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day.
3. Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.
4. Multivitamin p.o. daily.
5. Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.
6. Toprol-XL 25 mg once a day which I started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be
tolerating.
7. Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
8. Plavix 75 mg once a day.
9. Diovan 160 mg once a day.
10. Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.
11. Norvasc 5 mg once a day.
12. Lipitor 5 mg once a day.
13. Evista 60 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE. SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at
54.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs. She is divorced
and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood,
bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema,
pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that
she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08. No morning headaches or fatigue. No
psychiatric diagnosis. No psoriasis, no lupus. Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems
except as described above.
GENERAL: She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS: Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood
pressure 142/70, pulse 47, respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100%
HEENT: Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has moist mucosal membranes.
NECK: Veins are not distended. There are no carotid bruits.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.
HEART: S1 and S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops. PMI nondisplaced.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds present.
EXTREMITIES: Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Pulses grossly intact. Bilateral groins are
inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac
catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit
and intact distal pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute
and no acute disease.
Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27. BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9. Glucose 110.
Magnesium 2.5. ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08. INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white
blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with
arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has
now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be
that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery. In any case, given this
unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going
to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy. We
will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already. Aspirin,
Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc. I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently
had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion. I suppose it is
possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive
and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a
pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect. My concern is that there is
persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary
intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function. She will continue the
glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.
Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes. All this was discussed in detail with the
patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement. The patient desires full
resuscitation status.
